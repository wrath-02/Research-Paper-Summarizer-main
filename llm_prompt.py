#         Handwriting digit recognition has been widely explored using neural networks. Abu Ghosh and Maghari [1] conducted a comparative analysis of different neural network architectures, demonstrating that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperform traditional multilayer perceptron models in terms of accuracy and robustness. Their study highlights the importance of feature extraction and layer depth in achieving high classification performance.

#         Similarly, CNNs have also been applied to facial expression recognition. Alizadeh and Fazel [2] proposed a deep learning approach that utilizes convolutional layers to automatically extract features from facial images, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Their work underscores the effectiveness of deep networks in recognizing complex patterns in visual data.
